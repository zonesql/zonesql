Leaf's core http functionality packaged as a serve-yourself module. **Although seperated from Leaf core, it is still part of the default initial installation and doesn't need to be installed manually (unless you want a particular version).**

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf install http
```

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/http
```

## Basic Usage

The http module comes with a bunch of packages which help you manage the input and output of your app or API. This module comes with the most used Http related functionality like requests, responses, ...

The available classes in the Http module are:

- [`Leaf\Http\Request`](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/request)
- [`Leaf\Http\Response`](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/response)
- [`Leaf\Http\Headers`](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/headers)
- [`Leaf\Http\Cache`](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/cache)
- [`Leaf\Http\Status`](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/status)

**The docs for Leaf Http v2 can be found at [https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/v/2/](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/v/2/).**

## Request

This is a developer friendly interface which allows you to interact with data coming into your application. [Read the docs](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/request)

## Response

This interface allows you to output data from your application in different forms. [Read the docs](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/response)

## Headers

This interface allows you to manage headers in your application. [Read the docs](https://leafphp.dev/modules/http/headers)

## Cache
