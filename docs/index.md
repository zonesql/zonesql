# ZoneSQL

## Overview

ZoneSQL is a web based database interface application allowing SQL access to a 
number of different DBMS's including MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite. With 
the convenience of a web based architecture, ZoneSQL provides a rich efficient 
interface with the familiar look and feel of some existing powerful software 
based DBMS tools. This provides an optimal platform for working with SQL and 
data. 

The UI provides resizable panels including a full tree view of the server,
databases and tables, a syntax highlighted SQL query entry window, and a fully 
featured rich dynamic grid output. The product is useful for setting up direct 
access to databases at remote sites via simple web based access. Security and 
authentication are configurable.
